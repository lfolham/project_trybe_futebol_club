üìù Task
- TFC is an informative website about football matches and standings, where you can find all relevant information about football games.
- In this project, I was part of the development team responsible for building an API using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and integrating the applications using docker-compose, allowing them to work together while consuming a database.
- The main objective was to develop a dockerized backend using Sequelize for data modeling. Throughout the development process, we followed the business rules provided in the project. The built API can be consumed by the already available frontend.
- To add a match, an authentication token is required, ensuring that only logged-in users can make changes. Additionally, we established a relationship between the "teams" and "matches" tables to perform match updates.
- The developed backend implements business rules to correctly populate the table that will be displayed on the frontend for system users.
